      <h2>Biography</h2>
    </header>
    <p> 
      Hello! My name is Liesl White and I am a twenty year old individual currently near Seattle, WA. Although, I'm not from here at all. If I were to say I'm from anywhere, that would be Tucson, AZ. However, I've never lived anywhere for more than four years due to growing up in the military. I've lived all over the place, including Madrid, Spain and all the "A"-states in the US. For free time, I write novels and work on WebComics.

      <h3>Education</h3>
    </header>
    <p> 
      I graduated high school in 2020 and went to the University of Arizona that same year to study Wildlife Consevation and Management. After a year and a half of university, I realized pursuing higher education for the next couple of years turns out to be something I am not interested in. Then after taking a Python class and learning about Code Fellows through a family member, I decided to come here to Seattle and spend the next six months studying Software Developement.

      <h4>Job History</h4>
    </header>
    <p>
      Thus far, my job experience is varied considering it's been mainly minimum wage. My first offical job was as a Greenhouse Technician at my old highschool in New Jersey. I essentially ensured the quality of our products, which were vegetables donated to local shelters and flowers sold within our community. Then I was hired as a Waittress at a popular caffe in Tuscon, becoming a Barista, then an Assistant Manager. I left that place after around two years then became a Chilcare Program Assistant, working with and counseling youth ages 9-18. That was my last place of employment and now, I hope to become a Software Developer using the skills Code Fellows will provide me.

      <h5>Goals</h5>
    </header>
    <p>
      The overlying goal of course is to learn the ins-and-outs of software developement. Beyond that, I want to establish myself in a career field and begin a more steady climb in my life rather than living paycheck to paycheck on minimum wage. I am pretty young, especially compared to others within this class so I am lacking in experience in job readiness. I hope to make up for this in my tenacity and passion.
